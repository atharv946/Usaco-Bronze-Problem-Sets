[ Memory: 16 MB, CPU: 1 sec ]

Farmer John has N hills on his farm (1 <= N <= 1,000) of integer height in the range 0 .. 100. 

Farmer John wants the maximum difference between the tallest hill and the shortest hill to be 17 units. If it costs 𝑥2
 dollars to increase or decrease the height of a hill by x integer units, how much does Farmer John need to pay at minimum? 

INPUT FORMAT

Line 1: The integer N.
Lines 2..1+N: Each line contains the height of a single hill.
OUTPUT FORMAT

Line 1: The minimum amount FJ needs to pay to modify his hills. 

SAMPLE INPUT

5
20
9
3
25
22
SAMPLE OUTPUT

13
FJ keeps the hills of heights 20, 9, and 22 as they are.  He increases the height of the hill of height 3 to 6, which costs 3^2 = 9. He shortens the hill of height 25 to 23 at a cost of 2^2 = 4. Hence the total is 9+4=13.

                if (height < minHeight + amountIncrease) {
                    cost += (minHeight + amountIncrease - height) * (minHeight + amountIncrease - height);
                } else if (height > maxHeight - amountDecrease) {
                    cost += (height - (maxHeight - amountDecrease)) * (height - (maxHeight - amountDecrease));
